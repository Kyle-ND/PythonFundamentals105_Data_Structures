= Data Structures in Python Assessment

== Introduction

This assessment is designed to evaluate your understanding of data structures in Python. 
The assessment is divided into several sections, including multiple-choice questions, 
code implementation, analysis, and problem-solving tasks. This assessment covers the 
key concepts related to lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, as well as their practical applications.

== Instructions

Follow the instructions for each section carefully. 
You are required to answer all the questions and complete the coding tasks where applicable.

== Section 1: Multiple Choice Questions

1. What is the main difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
   a) Lists are mutable, and tuples are immutable.
   b) Lists are indexed by numbers, and tuples are indexed by strings.
   c) Lists can contain only numbers, while tuples can contain any data type.
   d) Lists and tuples are essentially the same.

2. In Python, which data structure is used to store key-value pairs?
   a) List
   b) Tuple
   c) Dictionary
   d) Set

3. What is the primary purpose of a set in Python?
   a) To store elements in an ordered sequence.
   b) To store key-value pairs.
   c) To store a collection of unique elements.
   d) To store elements in a sorted order.

4. Which of the following data structures in Python is not iterable?
   a) List
   b) Tuple
   c) Set
   d) Dictionary

5. How do you add an element at the end of a list in Python?
   a) Using the `add` method
   b) Using the `insert` method
   c) Using the `append` method
   d) Using the `extend` method

== Section 2: Code Implementation

6. Implement a Python function `find_common_elements(list1, list2)` 
that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing 
elements that are common in both lists.

7. Write a Python function `reverse_dictionary(input_dict)` that 
takes a dictionary as input and returns a new dictionary where 
the keys and values are reversed.

== Section 3: Code Analysis

8. Given a list with mixed data types: 
`[1, 'apple', 2.5, True, [4, 5, 6]]`, 
analyse and describe the advantages and disadvantages 
of using this list as a data structure in Python.

9. Consider a scenario where you need to store and 
manage a collection of student records, including their 
names and exam scores. Discuss which data structure in Python 
(list, tuple, dictionary, or set) would be the most suitable for this task and explain why.

== Section 4: Problem Solving

10. Write a Python program to find the intersection of two sets:
 `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.

11. You are given a list of words. 
Write a Python program to find the word that occurs most frequently in the list.

== Section 5: Short Answer

12. Explain the key characteristics and use cases of Python lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

13. Describe the concept of immutability and provide an example of an immutable data structure in Python.

== Section 6: Coding Challenge (Optional)

14. Design and implement a Python program that simulates a basic student record system. 
It should allow the user to add, update, and retrieve student records using dictionaries.
