# Tuple Exercises

# For each exercise, follow the TDD approach by writing test functions first 
# in the test file in this directory, making them fail, defining the function
# to make them compile, and then implementing the correct code to make the tests pass.

# Exercise 1: Examining Student Grades

# Given a list of student names and exam scores, convert it into a list of tuples.
# Access the first student's name and score.
# Calculate the average score of all the students.
# Find the student with the highest score.

# Exercise 2: Tuple Unpacking

# Create a list of book tuples (title, author).
# Unpack and print the titles of all the books.
# Unpack and print the authors of all the books.
