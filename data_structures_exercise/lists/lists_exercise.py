# List Exercises

# For each exercise, follow the TDD approach by writing test functions first 
# in the test file in this directory, making them fail, defining the function
# to make them compile, and then implementing the correct code to make the tests pass.

# Exercise 1: Manipulating a Shopping List

# Initialise an empty shopping list.
# Add 'apples', 'bananas', 'milk', 'eggs', and 'bread' to the list.
# Remove 'eggs' from the list.
# Replace 'apples' with 'strawberries'.
# Check if 'milk' is in the list.
# Sort the items in the shopping list in alphabetical order.

# Exercise 2: Tracking Daily Expenses

# Create a list of daily expenses with random numbers.
# Calculate and print the total expenses for the week.
# Find the most expensive expense in the list.
# Create a list of new expenses and extend the original list with these new expenses.
# Remove all expenses that are less than R10.
# Print the updated list of daily expenses.
