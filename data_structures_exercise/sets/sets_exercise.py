# Set Exercises

# For each exercise, follow the TDD approach by writing test functions first 
# in the test file in this directory, making them fail, defining the function
# to make them compile, and then implementing the correct code to make the tests pass.

# Exercise 1: Collecting Unique Colors

# Create two sets: my_colours and friend_colours with different colours.
# Find the union of your colours and your friend's colours.
# Find the colours that you both have in common.
# Add new unique colours to your set.
# Remove any colours that are not in your friend's set.
# Check if a specific colour is in your set.
